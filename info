first step is 
git clone https://github.com/yevheniistelmakh/123123.git
.
then we run
docker-compose up -d
Next you need to go into the container with magenta and php
docker exec -i id-conteiner /bin/sh
the next step is to install the composer
composer install
next we run the magenta configuration file
bin/magento setup:install \
                          ...
                          ...
at the end you should see a link to the admin panel that you need to add to our
domain.name:8081/admin_...
.
before going to the browser, you need to change the permission to a directory inside the php-magento container
/var/www # chmod -R 777 html/*
